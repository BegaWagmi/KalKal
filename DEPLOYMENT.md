# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Repository with your game code
- Code pushed to `main` or `master` branch

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Verify GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file should automatically:
- Trigger on pushes to main/master branch
- Build and deploy your game
- Make it available at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

### 3. Check Deployment Status

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click on the latest run to see details
4. Green checkmark = successful deployment

## 🌐 Access Your Game

Once deployed, your game will be available at:
**`https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`**

## 🔄 Update Your Game

### Automatic Deployment
```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update game features"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions will automatically deploy
# Check Actions tab for status
```

### Manual Deployment (if needed)
1. Go to repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Click **Re-run workflow** button
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails
1. Check **Actions** tab for error details
2. Verify all files are committed and pushed
3. Check for syntax errors in your code
4. Ensure `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists

### Game Not Loading

2. Verify all JavaScript files are accessible
3. Check network tab for failed requests
4. Ensure Phaser.js CDN is accessible

### Page Shows 404
1. Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete
2. Check if the `gh-pages` branch was created
3. Verify Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
4. Check repository visibility settings

## 📱 Testing Deployed Version

### Local vs Deployed
- **Local**: `http://localhost:8000` (for development)
- **Deployed**: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name` (for production)

### Cross-Platform Testing
- Test on different devices
- Check different browsers
- Verify mobile compatibility
- Test different screen sizes

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Public Access

- Ensure content is appropriate
- Don't violate copyright laws
- Keep file sizes reasonable

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Page Speed
- Use browser dev tools Performance tab
- Monitor load times
- Check for large assets
- Optimize images and code

### Analytics (Optional)
- Add Google Analytics
- Monitor user engagement
- Track performance metrics
- Identify improvement areas

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment
